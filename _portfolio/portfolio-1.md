This is a computer graphics project based in OpenGL in C++ that simulates fabric through a mesh of nodes connected by springs, that can be selected and modified to simulate different variations in cloth for animation purposes. The main purpose of this research project and question was to create connections between computer science and art through the field of computer graphics.

[This project was defended as an undergraduate thesis project at Oregon State University on May 30th, 2025.](https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/honors_college_theses/kw52jj652?locale=en)
