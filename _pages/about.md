I am a Computer Science Masters student at Georgia Institute of Technology, specializing in Computer Graphics. I'm passionate about all aspects of computer graphics, from developing video games to making interactive animation programs using OpenGL and other graphics software libraries. I also have a fondness for low-level systems programming in C and Assembly, computer architecture, FPGAS, and embedded software. Above all, I love getting hands-on with code and seeing my projects change in real time!

In my free time, I enjoy drawing and making art in all types of mediums, both digital and traditional.
